Please go through the following steps to set up your environment

### **Step 2: XAMPP Installation**

### **Step 3: Composer Installation**

Install Composer from the [official website](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

### **Step 4: Project Deployment**

Unzip the provided project archive into the **`htdocs`** directory of XAMPP.

### **Step 5: Composer Dependencies**

Open your system console, navigate to the project folder, and execute **`composer install`** to install the required PHP packages, including Eloquent ORM. 

### **Step 6: Database Configuration** (skip this step if you have done so before)

Create a PostgreSQL database named **`THSR`**. Import the provided **`.sql`** file to populate your database with the necessary tables and data.

### **Step 7: Eloquent Configuration**

Configure the database connection in **`eloquent.php`** with your PostgreSQL credentials. Put your password in **`db_password.txt`**.

### **Step 9: Installing PostgreSQL driver for PHP**

Go to your PHP directory (e.g., at **`C:\xampp\php`**) to edit php.ini using any plain text editor. Uncomment **`;extension=pdo_pgsql`** and **`;extension=pgsql'** by removing the semicolons.
